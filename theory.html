                <h1>A Reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message'</h1>
                <p>Today I read a paper called <i>The Medium is the Message</i> by Marshall McLuhan. Though the piece is
                    representative of its time in a few ways, such as treatment of Africans as universally illiterate,
                    it is
                    also foresightful in its conception of “electric media” as a force of significant societal change,
                    and
                    thoughtful in considering the connection inherent between the medium of transmission and the message
                    within. After reading, I was aware of a significant prediction in the piece. McLuhan mentions that
                    “each
                    of the media is also a powerful weapon with which to clobber other media and other groups. The
                    result is
                    that the present age has been one of multiple civil wars that are not limited to the world of art
                    and
                    entertainment” (McLuhan, 1964).
                </p>
                <p>This has proven true in every new form of media we have created since McLuhan wrote this paper,
                    perhaps
                    even progressively so, with the newest forms of media, social media, featuring extraordinary amounts
                    of
                    direct conflict (Anderson, 2018) (Leighton, 2019). It is also the case that this trend of increasing
                    conflict follows the trend of increasing interactability of new media. If this understanding is
                    correct,
                    then over time our conflicts in the real world may continue to be superseded by conflicts in the
                    progressively interactable realm of digital media. It may be the case then, that as these new media
                    become the “technological staples”, the “unique cultural flavor” (McLuhan, 1964) they bring may be
                    one
                    of division and discord.

                <br>
                <h1>The Memex and the Message</h1>
                <p>Vannevar Bush’s paper As We May Think was written half a century before his ideas manifested in
                    the World Wide Web. On its 65th anniversary, the paper was reviewed by Simon Harper in ‘As We
                    May Think’ At 65, discussing the value and predictive power it holds even today. Noted in
                    Harper’s paper, is Bush’s intention for the Memex to be a mechanical device, elucidating the
                    fact that all technologies Bush discussed take a significantly different physical form today
                    than he predicted. Nonetheless, ideas and insights from his paper remain deeply relevant, such
                    as the idea that the Memex would be a “device for individual use”, adapted to its user and their
                    specific needs. Harper makes this idea explicit, saying “The key point here is the idea that
                    human understanding and cognition can be enhanced by tailoring information, and the associations
                    between this information, to the way that the human brain is organised”.

                </p>
                <p>Online services such as Spotify, Netflix, and Facebook have taken this concept and applied it to
                    human experience, enhancing each user’s time on their platform by providing content tailored to
                    the individual. In the case of Netflix, different users are shown different cover art for the
                    same shows and movies depending on a digital psychological profile created by algorithmic
                    processing of their viewing habits, with the purpose of providing quality information about each
                    show or movie to users who process information uniquely. The contrast of Bush’s spot on “vision
                    of how information could be manageable even on a large scale by association based on the
                    experience of the individual” and his far less accurate idea of the medium through which that
                    information would pass calls into question the strength of the idea that the medium is the
                    message.

                </p>

                <p>I have discussed Marshall McLuhan’s idea of the message being inseparable from the message on
                    this blog before. McLuhan provides historical evidence to back up his theory, such as the effect
                    of print media on the French Revolution. Yet, looking back from McLuhan’s perspective, and
                    forward from Bush’s, it seems plausible that the medium does not so much affect the message as
                    it enables new kinds of messages to be popularized. Bush predicted the individualisation of the
                    message not because his preferred medium of “rods, gears, pulleys and rotors” imbues information
                    with an essence of the individual, but because computation allows fundamentally new kinds of
                    messages to be transmitted. Perhaps print only provided the ideas of liberté, égalité, and
                    fraternité a mode of transmission, and had radio instead of print emerged as the technology of
                    transmission at the time, a very similar French Revolution would have occurred, with the same
                    message of liberté, égalité, and fraternité as its engine.

                <h1>What Do Users Have To Say About Design?</h1>
                <p>The paper <i>Revealing the Hidden Rationality of User Browsing Behaviour</i> is another older paper I
                    have read recently. It contains a data-driven analysis of three different types of communicative
                    techniques within web design; Visual, Verbal, and Neutral. It asks the question of whether different
                    users have preferences for one type of design over another, with the hope that the answer could
                    provide insights into how personalisation might be used to enhance educational web applications.
                    With the advent of significant remote learning activities in early 2020, and with their continued
                    presence up until the present day, even a small design change on educational websites could have a
                    large impact.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Before analysing the paper’s finding, it is worth examining when and how it arrived at those answers.
                    The first issue worth highlighting is the date the paper was published, back in 2007. For average
                    academic writing, this is not terribly old, but technology moves faster than other fields, and web
                    technology specifically so. As such, the findings may not be as relevant today as they were then.
                    Secondly, the sample of users tested, only 144, was made up entirely of Computer Science students
                    from the University of Nottingham. This sample is not a representative slice of any population, as
                    women have historically been underrepresented of in Computer Science, and older users experience the
                    web, and technology in general, differently than those of average college age. Additionally, half of
                    the sessions did not switch between the modes, leaving the sample size for some calculations at only
                    84.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now that some important shortcomings of the paper have been addressed, the findings can be better
                    understood in context. Likely as expected, the more visual modes faired significantly better than
                    the Verbal mode. This reinforces the idea the visual stimulus such as images is important for
                    maintaining the attention of a user, and that text-heavy design is not as accessible. The paper
                    found little evidence of mode switching as a preference driven activity, meaning there it provides
                    no evidence personalization would improve learning outcomes. However, the paper did find that mode
                    switching could be used to alleviate boredom. This finding has the implication that monotonous
                    design may lead to less attention from users and poorer educational outcomes, and design which
                    introduces a new look to an application after some time may improve attention and lead to better
                    educational outcomes. This is not a surprising outcome, but it is clear in the data and easily
                    actionable by web designers. Further study is needed to reproduce this outcome more robustly, but in
                    the meantime, designing applications with more interesting and varied interfaces may not be a bad
                    habit.

                <h1>Internet Inequities</h1>
                <br>
                <p><i>Towards a study of information geographies:(im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the
                        geographies of information </i>is a paper which, through vast amounts of data superbly
                    visualized, demonstrates the inequities that exist on the Internet. Though this study is from before
                    oceanic currents worsened the African continent’s access to the Internet, its relevance is not
                    diminished but rather amplified, as the inequities it outlines have been amplified. Of particular
                    interest to me, and I believe to South Africa, is the discrepancy between the population of internet
                    users and domain names, Wikipedia edits, and GitHub commits outlined in the study. This represents a
                    difference in agency online, and a difference in who is speaking and who is listening.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Internet is powerful. This is not a disputed fact. Having a voice on the Internet is having
                    power, and this power can be used to spread truth or lies, and mobilize hate or compassion. When
                    oppressors are the ones with a voice, they use it for their own gain at the expense of others, and
                    are able to spread lies and hate on a whim. At no time was this clearer than during Donald Trump’s
                    four years as president of the United States, with his prolific use of Twitter inspiring multiple
                    acts of violence. But when the oppressed can speak up and be heard, truth can break through and
                    instigate change. At no time was this clearer than during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020,
                    ignited in response to a video of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of four police officers. The
                    video was widely shared on social media, spoken so loudly and so ubiquitously that it could not go
                    unheard, even by those who tried to ignore it. The changes brought about because of that voice,
                    amplified by millions of black people with lived experience of racial discrimination around the
                    world, though far from enough, is significant and important. Lives are demonstrably better today
                    than they were in 2020 because of that voice.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>But South Africans and other Africans today do not have a voice like those in Europe or North
                    America, and we go unheard because of it. We do not even write our own stories. They are written by
                    others. This is exemplified by the data on Wikipedia edits for the African continent, where only 5%
                    of edits on articles about Africa are made by Africans. This kind of digital colonialism extends to
                    South Africa as well, where we write less than half of Wikipedia articles about ourselves.
                    Structural changes are needed to address this issue, such as Wikipedia servers located in Africa for
                    when undersea fibre is disrupted. I hope my own small actions, such as the GitHub commit that will
                    send this article online, push the world slightly in the right direction.</p>

                <h1>Speech on the Web</h1>
                <p>Today, I’d like to explore the idea of free speech and its storied relationship with space on the
                    web. This is a conversation that has, frequently in the past and even occasionally up until today,
                    been appropriated by the far-right, homophobes, anti-semites, and those generally interested in
                    spreading hate, so I will tread carefully. To begin, a look into the legal treatment of public space
                    online is necessary. But first, a caveat; laws regarding the web and what kinds of speech are
                    allowed on it vary by country, and this discussion will focus on the enormous impact United States
                    law has had in shaping online speech worldwide, as well as international forces which affect this
                    issue. As South Africa is part of the global community which uses and is affected by the largest
                    shifts in policy on the web, it is important to have not only a local, but also an international
                    perspective, and this will become clear when I discuss how policies enacted by one government are
                    likely to affect citizens in other countries.

                <p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is in many ways the founding legal document of speech
                    on the web. Almost all debate about whether the First Amendment, which enshrines the right to free
                    speech in the United States, applies online is concentrated around the distinction between platforms
                    and publishers. This distinction essentially means that if one is labelled a publisher, they are
                    responsible for the legality of their content, and may be sued for publishing, for example,
                    defamatory content. This is the same standard to which newspapers are held, as each is ultimately
                    responsible for what they publish. If a one is labelled a platform, they are instead treated like a
                    host or a passive carrier of third-party information, and are not liable for illegal content shared
                    by third parties. This is the same standard to which book stores are held, as they cannot be
                    expected to read and legally vet every line of every book they sell. Section 230(c) defines websites
                    which host third-party content, such as forum posts, as platforms rather than publishers, stating
                    that:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker
                    of any information provided by another information content provider.”
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>These are the proverbial “Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet”, as, without the legal
                    protections they provide, the status of public space on the internet would be unrecognizable.
                    Protection under Section 230 is, however, predicated on websites moderating their platforms in
                    good-faith, incentivizing companies to create spaces that are friendly to many different users and
                    that do not fill up with illegal content such as defamatory statements. This means that speech on
                    these platforms is not legally protected in the same way as free speech in a public space.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This has some clear advantages. Moderated websites, such as Twitter, do not generally foster the kind
                    of hate that largely unmoderated sites, like 8chan, do. Unmoderated sites have, on a number of
                    occasions, been implicated in radicalizing terrorists and inspiring hate crimes, such as the
                    Christchurch shooting in 2019 (The New York Times, 2019). However, companies do not have a spotless
                    record of enforcing their policies, and moderation is often spotty at best on platforms which
                    hundreds of millions or even billions use on a daily basis. With so much of so many people’s time
                    spent on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, it is worth considering if these companies
                    should dictate policies to their millions or billions of users, policies many disagree with or many
                    want legitimately enforced. The question of whether these digital spaces should become more
                    democratic, better regulated by governments, or should be run solely by the companies which own
                    them, is a question that cannot be answered in a short blog post.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now that some important shortcomings of the paper have been addressed, the findings can be better
                    understood in context. Likely as expected, the more visual modes faired significantly better than
                    the Verbal mode. This reinforces the idea the visual stimulus such as images is important for
                    maintaining the attention of a user, and that text-heavy design is not as accessible. The paper
                    found little evidence of mode switching as a preference driven activity, meaning there it provides
                    no evidence personalization would improve learning outcomes. However, the paper did find that mode
                    switching could be used to alleviate boredom. This finding has the implication that monotonous
                    design may lead to less attention from users and poorer educational outcomes, and design which
                    introduces a new look to an application after some time may improve attention and lead to better
                    educational outcomes. This is not a surprising outcome, but it is clear in the data and easily
                    actionable by web designers. Further study is needed to reproduce this outcome more robustly, but in
                    the meantime, designing applications with more interesting and varied interfaces may not be a bad
                    habit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, I will entertain two thoughts important to the status of free speech on the web. The first
                    is presented by Laura Stein in her paper <i>Speech Without Rights: The Status of Public Space on the
                        Internet</i>. Stein argues that it is problematic that the law does not recognize any digital
                    spaces as public forums. There are many spaces in the physical world with no protections for free
                    speech, yet a few spaces are set aside for this essential right to flourish, because its
                    constitutionally mandated status and its value to democracy demand it. Stein applies this idea, that
                    free speech is valuable and necessary for democracy, through the use of communication-centered
                    democratic theory, to argue that a few designated digital spaces should receive some affirmative
                    speech rights.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Superficially, this argument sounds impenetrable, but a moment’s reflection on the examples of such
                    spaces that have existed on the web, such as 8chan and Gab, created with the explicit goal of
                    providing a home for free speech, invariably attract those whose hate cannot find a home elsewhere.
                    This, however, may be a problem that could be solved in such a set-aside space by, for example,
                    removing anonymity from the speakers, just as public speech is not usually anonymous is the real
                    world.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The second idea is that of virtual spaces as sovereign entities unto themselves, with some, though
                    not all, of the properties of countries. This is an idea posited not as something that would be a
                    solution to the issue of free speech online, but as an appraisal of our current reality by Hank
                    Green in his video <i>Why TikTok has me Terrified</i>. In this video, he discusses the impacts of
                    social media on society at large, with TikTok as a case study. To ground why this discussion is
                    important, he says he is terrified of Google and Facebook because they are corporations, “and we
                    live there.” As a creator on YouTube, Hank runs his business, socializes, and spends much of his
                    leisure time in the digital space of YouTube. This corporation functions much like any physical
                    space in all of these important ways, yet is not driven by the communities it serves, rather it is
                    driven by profit. And while American corporations like Google and Facebook have some oversight from
                    the somewhat democratic US government, companies like TikTok are fully under the authoritarian power
                    of the Chinese government, while still being driven by profit. This creates significant problems of
                    sovereignty, as Chinese apps have repeatedly removed speech critical of the Communist Party of
                    China, even in countries like the United States and South Africa.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>So our digital spaces, which are becoming more and more central in the lives of people around the
                    world, are not places with speech protection under law, and are driven not by the democratic
                    principles which govern the physical spaces of South Africa, but rather by the motivation of profit.
                    I hope this discussion has inspired thoughts of your own, dear reader, and that you will take some
                    time to think of how you envision speech in the digital spaces we spend our time in.

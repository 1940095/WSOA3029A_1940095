                <h1>A Reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message'</h1>
                <p>Today I read a paper called <i>The Medium is the Message</i> by Marshall McLuhan. Though the piece is
                    representative of its time in a few ways, such as treatment of Africans as universally illiterate,
                    it is
                    also foresightful in its conception of “electric media” as a force of significant societal change,
                    and
                    thoughtful in considering the connection inherent between the medium of transmission and the message
                    within. After reading, I was aware of a significant prediction in the piece. McLuhan mentions that
                    “each
                    of the media is also a powerful weapon with which to clobber other media and other groups. The
                    result is
                    that the present age has been one of multiple civil wars that are not limited to the world of art
                    and
                    entertainment” (McLuhan, 1964).
                </p>
                <p>This has proven true in every new form of media we have created since McLuhan wrote this paper,
                    perhaps
                    even progressively so, with the newest forms of media, social media, featuring extraordinary amounts
                    of
                    direct conflict (Anderson, 2018) (Leighton, 2019). It is also the case that this trend of increasing
                    conflict follows the trend of increasing interactability of new media. If this understanding is
                    correct,
                    then over time our conflicts in the real world may continue to be superseded by conflicts in the
                    progressively interactable realm of digital media. It may be the case then, that as these new media
                    become the “technological staples”, the “unique cultural flavor” (McLuhan, 1964) they bring may be
                    one
                    of division and discord.

                <h1>The Memex and the Message</h1>
                <p>Vannevar Bush’s paper As We May Think was written half a century before his ideas manifested in
                    the World Wide Web. On its 65th anniversary, the paper was reviewed by Simon Harper in ‘As We
                    May Think’ At 65, discussing the value and predictive power it holds even today. Noted in
                    Harper’s paper, is Bush’s intention for the Memex to be a mechanical device, elucidating the
                    fact that all technologies Bush discussed take a significantly different physical form today
                    than he predicted. Nonetheless, ideas and insights from his paper remain deeply relevant, such
                    as the idea that the Memex would be a “device for individual use”, adapted to its user and their
                    specific needs. Harper makes this idea explicit, saying “The key point here is the idea that
                    human understanding and cognition can be enhanced by tailoring information, and the associations
                    between this information, to the way that the human brain is organised”.

                </p>
                <p>Online services such as Spotify, Netflix, and Facebook have taken this concept and applied it to
                    human experience, enhancing each user’s time on their platform by providing content tailored to
                    the individual. In the case of Netflix, different users are shown different cover art for the
                    same shows and movies depending on a digital psychological profile created by algorithmic
                    processing of their viewing habits, with the purpose of providing quality information about each
                    show or movie to users who process information uniquely. The contrast of Bush’s spot on “vision
                    of how information could be manageable even on a large scale by association based on the
                    experience of the individual” and his far less accurate idea of the medium through which that
                    information would pass calls into question the strength of the idea that the medium is the
                    message.

                </p>

                <p>I have discussed Marshall McLuhan’s idea of the message being inseparable from the message on
                    this blog before. McLuhan provides historical evidence to back up his theory, such as the effect
                    of print media on the French Revolution. Yet, looking back from McLuhan’s perspective, and
                    forward from Bush’s, it seems plausible that the medium does not so much affect the message as
                    it enables new kinds of messages to be popularized. Bush predicted the individualisation of the
                    message not because his preferred medium of “rods, gears, pulleys and rotors” imbues information
                    with an essence of the individual, but because computation allows fundamentally new kinds of
                    messages to be transmitted. Perhaps print only provided the ideas of liberté, égalité, and
                    fraternité a mode of transmission, and had radio instead of print emerged as the technology of
                    transmission at the time, a very similar French Revolution would have occurred, with the same
                    message of liberté, égalité, and fraternité as its engine.

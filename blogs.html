                <h1>Reading The Library of Babel in the Library</h1>
                <p>
                    This morning class 8a had a lesson scheduled in the library computer lab, but the Internet went down
                    halfway
                    through. Ms Morgan handed them over to me when she had finished what she could without an Internet
                    connection. I thought it would be fun to blow the kids’ minds a bit and read them a story about the
                    near-infinite Internet they were currently unable to access. We read The Library of Babel by Jorge
                    Luis
                    Borges. One student said that it is easier to find things on Wikipedia than in The Library of Babel,
                    and
                    also easier than finding a book in our school library. I told him he should pay closer attention
                    next
                    time I
                    explain how to find books in the library, but that the Internet is often quite easy to navigate
                    these
                    days.
                    However, things were not always so organized. D.C. Denison of the Boston Globe said in the early
                    days of
                    the
                    Internet that it “may be the world’s greatest library, but let’s face it-all the books are scattered
                    on
                    the
                    floor.” I asked if the students ever felt that the books were still scattered on the floor, or if
                    there
                    were
                    ever just too many books to find the right one among them. A girl raised her hand and said that she
                    had
                    felt
                    a bit sick this week. She had then looked online to see if she was coming down with something, but
                    there
                    were so many results saying different things that she just came away confused and anxious. I told
                    her I
                    hoped she was feeling better, and that she was quite similar to the librarians in the story, knowing
                    the
                    correct answer is out there, but not sure how to find it, or even to recognize it if it is found.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Then I asked how many students had used Wikipedia to learn something this week. Most hands shot up. I
                    asked
                    the same question again, but about YouTube instead. Fewer hands were raised. A student seated at the
                    back of
                    the group said she wanted to, but ran out of data watching a video on the amphibians they were
                    learning
                    about in Biology this week. I told her that she had brought up a very important point. The Library
                    of
                    Babel
                    talks about the structure of the library, how it has a lot of stairs, how the shelves are arranged,
                    and
                    how
                    the librarians move around it. I asked the students what would happen if a librarian was in a
                    wheelchair,
                    and couldn’t move up or down the stairs. The student at the back responded that they wouldn’t be
                    able to
                    read any of the books that were on a higher or lower level, and that maybe the library should have
                    some
                    elevators. I told her that was a pretty good idea.

                <h1>Some Quantum Mechanics</h1>
                <p>Having read The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges with class 8a, and not having much to do
                    with the Internet down again, I read another of his great works, The Garden of Forking Paths,
                    right after the class had left. Both are such interesting explorations of the infinite and its
                    relationship to the accessibility of information. While the infinite nature of The Library of
                    Babel is what keeps its information inaccessible, the nature of the universe performs that role
                    in The Garden of Forking Paths. Obviously, Borges had some meaningful understanding of physics,
                    as the branching universe he describes treads the line between the many-worlds interpretation of
                    quantum mechanics and a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence. Though this may sound terribly
                    complex, I assure you that if I, who spent no time in university in a physics classroom, can
                    understand the basics, you can too. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first of these concepts, the many-worlds interpretation, is quite simple. When an event on
                    the quantum scale occurs, all possible outcomes of that event do in fact occur, and we only see
                    one outcome because we live on a single path, unable to occupy multiple forks at once. The
                    second, quantum decoherence, is somewhat more complex, but not beyond the understanding of a
                    layperson. Essentially, it describes a loss of information as the reason we can see only one
                    result. For a more full understanding, check out this <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlOwJWJWPUs">video</a>. This may be why the
                    character Ts’ui
                    Pên was able to create “an incomplete, but not false, image of the universe”, and why The Garden
                    of Forking Paths is seen as impossible to interpret by many who encounter it. Interestingly, our
                    ability to process new types of information today hinges on our ability to interpret forking
                    paths and decoherence inside the field of quantum computing.

                <h1>HTML 5 and Semantics</h1>
                <p>
                    This week, I read an article on HTML 5 and its often confusingly named elements. The title, Why You
                    Should Choose HTML5 article Over section, is fairly self-explanatory, but the content delves deep
                    into the nuances, often non-sensical, of HTML5. Elements exist for different purposes, and the name
                    article seems to imply a quite simple meaning: if you want to represent a self-contained
                    composition, such as a blog post or newspaper article, use the article element. However, the author
                    writes that in fact, article could refer to many other kinds of content, from YouTube videos to
                    products for sale on Amazon. This raises the question of what use the section element has, and
                    confusingly, it largely overlaps with article, as both are “sectioning” elements in HTML5.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>All of this had my head spinning. On top of the confusion produced by the article itself, I had just
                    been told by my techwiz friends, Michele and Fortunate, that div elements are the spawn of satan and
                    that section elements are gifts from heaven. But I persevered, and by the end of the article, a
                    couple of things became clear. First, browser developers and the World Wide Web Consortium do not
                    always have their crap together! Secondly, section elements can be used well, and do in fact work
                    better than div elements in a few areas, but they require some markup information to work best. So,
                    from now on, I will be adding aria-labels to my section elements for better accessibility of my
                    website!

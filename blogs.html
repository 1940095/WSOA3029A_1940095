                <h1>A Close Reading of <i>Theories of Representation</i></h1>
                <p>
                    From the very first passage, Jenny Kidd engages representation as a thoroughly complex act, which
                    exists as defined by Jen Webb as the way “we understand our environments and each other” and “how we
                    both are, and how we understand ourselves”. The vector through which not only understanding of our
                    surroundings, our fellow humans, and our self-conceptions passes, but which also informs our very
                    being, is a hugely influential vector. To engage the subject “comprehensively” would be a near
                    impossible task, so Kidd instead attempts to engage with the discourse around representation
                    holistically. She outlines five key modes that inform how representation interfaces with the world,
                    those of representation and reality; representation and myth; representation and visual
                    communication; representation as persuasion; and representation and identity politics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first of these is concerned with the ontological nature of our existence, and the epistemic
                    relationship between experience and the outside world. Kidd engages with Stuart Hall’s
                    constructivist framework, in which the relationship between the sign and perception is primary,
                    while the relationship between the sign and any kind of objective reality that might exist is
                    limited, and quite possibly unknowable or absurd to even consider, as all that can be known must be
                    perceived to be known, and inherent in perception is the act of representation. These perceptions
                    could be direct, human perceptions, such as the experience of seeing a flower with one’s own eyes.
                    In such a case, the signified flower is immediately assigned connections which are arbitrary, such
                    as the word for red in any number of languages, which themselves bear no meaningful relationship
                    with the colour itself. Taking this one step further, even the colour of flower as directly
                    experienced by the brain is a connection that is flimsy at best. Those with
                    Deuteranopia, a type of red-green colourblindness, experience colour differently than most people,
                    with less vibrance and distinction between reds and greens. Similarly, those who have had the lenses
                    of their eyes removed experience colour beyond the normal visible spectrum, and might perceive an
                    ultraviolet tint to the flower that most others could not. To ask the question of who is seeing the
                    flower as it “truly” or “really” exists, is a question of superficial folly.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Yet distinctions have utility in society, even if what they distinguish is not so clear cut as their
                    representations could imply. Kidd quotes Marcel Danesi to make explicit the value of such semiotic
                    categories. “‘Simply put, it behoves us to make sure that our children will be able to distinguish a
                    meaningful news documentary from an ad for running shoes’ (2002: 216)”. In separating “meaningful
                    news documentary” into its own category, completely distinct and identifiably different from “ad for
                    running shoes”, the very construction of meaning is happening. From another perspective, such as an
                    anticapitalist perspective, a news documentary made by a billion dollar corporation and an ad for
                    running shoes made by a billion dollar corporation may not be so distinct, especially as one might
                    attempt to appropriate the signs of the other as to better accomplish its goals. However, few would
                    dispute the news we read, the content we see online, and the people we interact with shape our view
                    of the world, and eventually the actions we take as informed by those influences. The ability to
                    distinguish and label “fake news” or “advertisement”, though a constructivist act in itself, is of
                    immense value to both children and adults. So, even though “nothing is born into the world with
                    meaning, but it is assigned a meaning” (Hall, 1997: 25), the meanings that we assign have impacts in
                    the world and on its inhabitants, and cognisance of this fact is important at the outset of all
                    representational acts.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kidd engages representation and its relationship to myth next. She uses the work of another
                    semiotician, Roland Barthes, to inform her discussion. She outlines his work on denotation and
                    connotation with an example using the Apple logo, exploring the way in which denotative meanings can
                    be arbitrarily related to connotative meanings. Though a denotative level interpretation of the
                    Apple logo may only describe it as a representation of a fruit, the connotative level interpretation
                    may incorporate ideas of luxury and technology, near entirely separated from the denotative meanings
                    which can be drawn. This making of myth exists across society, in the form of religious symbols,
                    brand logos, but Kidd also highlights myth’s less visible forms, like “the the struggle for good
                    over evil” or “the loss of women’s innocence”, “things we encounter all of the time in film, tv and
                    advertising, but don’t always ‘see’ (Barthes, 1957)”.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Different responses to myth are possible. Presented with one, and able to identify it as myth, its
                    messages can be accepted or rejected, with readings orthodox or subversive (Hall, 1980). In engaging
                    the language and representations of others, especially those connected to institutions with power,
                    important work must be done to avoid repeating myths which are harmful or serve to further empower
                    those with undue societal influence. An example of such is the homogenized representation of Muslims
                    in Western media as a singular “other”, with stereotyped ideas of religious extremism applied
                    wholesale to more than a billion individuals. In such cases, perpetuating the myth is not only
                    perpetuating falsehoods, it is causing harm to peaceful communities. With this in mind, identifying
                    myths is not only important for honest communication, it is necessary to protect people who are
                    demonized because of what they believe or who they are.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kidd next engages how representation impacts visual communication. Any kind of communication must
                    include the encoding of information in a form that is digestible by a receiving party, and the
                    decoding which is necessary to interpret that information. This process is important to the work of
                    data visualization, as all the complexities of the world must be compressed first into usable data,
                    then that data must be compressed into a form often displayed or printed on a two dimensional
                    surface, and the final product should, in some way, be decoded by a viewer as to communicate
                    something about the complexities of the world. With all of these steps, the task of honesty and
                    accuracy is a daunting if not impossible one, and those who use visual communication forms like
                    infographics should be aware of these challenges. Kidd highlights their use in important situations
                    like elections, and how they can tell a convincing, singular narrative, “when often the data they
                    rely on is speculative or partial at best.” </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This phenomenon was quite publicly showcased as polling data was visualized and published across
                    television networks, newspapers, and websites showing Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump in the
                    2016 presidential election. The consequences of the implications of such visualizations, that
                    Clinton was going to beat Trump by a wide margin and with ease, are that some prospective Democratic
                    voters may have stayed home instead of voting, assured that victory was going to be achieved without
                    them, and that Trump voters may have been energized to vote, knowing that without them victory could
                    not be achieved. If infographics did have such an effect, then the representational power of data
                    visualization is enormous, and this possibility should be carefully considered by all who use it.
                    This issue is exacerbated by the fact that data visualization can be used to misrepresent
                    statistical findings, such as by displaying a graph with it’s y-axis starting from 30% rather than
                    from 0%, to make the difference between a variable at 45% and a variable at 55% seem larger than it
                    is. With possible issues both in the data and in the representations of that data, it is valuable to
                    carefully engage any data visualization to make sure it is not simply being used as a tool of
                    persuasion.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kidd’s next point is that of how persuasion interacts with representation. This domain is home to a
                    whole professional class, that of advertising. To illustrate the practice of persuasion through
                    representation, Kidd reproduces the text of a Facebook ad’s voiceover. The ad, which incorporates
                    myth and visual communication to influence a viewer’s perception of reality, focusses on the ways in
                    which Facebook is a space of connection, and attempts to appropriate the connotations of other
                    connectively connotated signs, such as chairs and airplanes. However, the ad was not successful in
                    2012 when it was released or especially in text only form, as it has been reproduced by Kidd. This
                    is because the persuasive intent of the ad is too readily apparent, and its message too absurd to be
                    paired with such a transparent attempt at brand building. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kidd engages representation and its relationship to myth next. She uses the work of another
                    semiotician, Roland Barthes, to inform her discussion. She outlines his work on denotation and
                    connotation with an example using the Apple logo, exploring the way in which denotative meanings can
                    be arbitrarily related to connotative meanings. Though a denotative level interpretation of the
                    Apple logo may only describe it as a representation of a fruit, the connotative level interpretation
                    may incorporate ideas of luxury and technology, near entirely separated from the denotative meanings
                    which can be drawn. This making of myth exists across society, in the form of religious symbols,
                    brand logos, but Kidd also highlights myth’s less visible forms, like “the the struggle for good
                    over evil” or “the loss of women’s innocence”, “things we encounter all of the time in film, tv and
                    advertising, but don’t always ‘see’ (Barthes, 1957)”.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    However, not every advertising campaign is so inept, or so explicitly an advertising campaign. Apple
                    is understood worldwide as a company associated with quality and luxury, yet its competitors often
                    create products with significantly superior materials and features while remaining less prestigious
                    than Apple. And while Tesla claims to create run advertisements for its products, instead
                    reinvesting money into creating more value for consumers, it holds events where it receives immense,
                    and free, press coverage. At these events, bold claims are made, stunning videos are shown, and new
                    products are announced to consumers and investors alike, driving up the company’s stock price and
                    driving demand for pre orders of products that do not yet exist. This lucrative industry of
                    persuasive representation is one which many in digital spaces find themselves working, and the
                    ethical considerations for such a career are made clear by Kidd’s discussion of the issue.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Finally, Kidd moves to identity politics and its relationship to representation. She engages issues
                    of problematic representation in media. There is a tendency for certain groups to be
                    under-represented while others are over-represented. For instance, women make up around half of the
                    population, but they are often under-represented in film; that is, there are not many films with
                    female characters, and even those with female characters are not well-written. In fact, of all of
                    the main roles in a given movie only a third are female. In television, the number is only slightly
                    higher at 35% (Lauzen, 2018). The under-representation of women in film means that they are often
                    typecast, meaning they are cast as a specific type of role more two dimensional and generic than
                    individual and unique, possibly a submissive one or one with little power. Though it is not
                    inherently problematic for anyone to be represented in a submissive role, whether they identify as a
                    woman, man, or agender person, this can often become a negative thing when one group is
                    near-universally represented this way.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Kidd then emphasizes the consequences and power of representations, “over what is deemed acceptable,
                    what is unsayable, what is punishable.” Representations conceived of yesterday have created the
                    myths which hold power over society today, and if constructivism is right, then we have the power
                    today to create representations which will form a better tomorrow.

                <h1>A Close Reading of <i>A Utopian Belief In Big Data</i></h1>
                <p>Data, in all its varieties, and especially the “big” kind, is having more and more influence on the
                    modern world. Esther Keymolen tackles the complexities which arise from this phenomenon, engaging
                    the real-world benefits big data has provided, as well as the potential harms inherent in the use of
                    such a powerful technology. From the outset, Keymolen makes clear that the utopian view of big data
                    is not one which holds water, and in the article, uses the philosophical arguments of Helmuth
                    Plessner to solidify her position. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Early in the article, Keymolen provides the example of Californian predictive policing, responsible
                    for a 25% drop in robberies, as a positive use case for the technology. She also references uses in
                    the Dutch tax system and in personalized medical treatment. Yet throughout the rest of the article,
                    she does not provide further engagement with real-world examples of big data. I view this exclusion
                    as a disservice to a full view of the forces at play and the ramifications of big data’s gradual
                    worldwide roll-out. Without reference to the worst uses of big data in comparison to its best uses,
                    its overall effect on the world, for better or worse, cannot be evaluated. The clearest examples of
                    abuse are in China, where millions of Muslim minority members are under constant surveillance, with
                    their day to day activities tracked in enormous databases that log everything from their attendance
                    at Mosque to their visits to friends (Human Rights Watch, 2019), and with a nationwide social credit
                    system, which logs activities as minor as jaywalking, and can remove a citizen’s access to public
                    transportation or even suspend their rights (Kobie, 2019). However, these most egregious uses of big
                    data were not well known in 2016, the year Keymolen’s article was published, and her philosophically
                    grounded arguments against utopian belief have value in assessing the more fundamental possibilities
                    and impossibilities associated with big data.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Putting Plessner’s ideas of humans’ natural artificiality to use, Keymolen explores the ways in
                    which we exist as not only ourselves, but also as the tools we use. In this view, technology forms a
                    component of our eccentric existences, as we try to create a stable and understandable home “by
                    repeatedly reinterpreting and carving out [our] lives”. As part of this process, “the world human
                    beings inhabit can become a familiar, less complex world.” This “unbreakable alliance between human
                    beings and artefacts” as Keymolen refers to it, alludes to the fact that something of a Wienerian
                    cybernetic relationship exists in society today, not only on an individual level with the use of
                    smartphones, wearables, and computers, but on a much larger, institutional scale, with the use of
                    massive data sets embedded deeply in day-to-day operations and decision-making.

                <p>

                    The purpose of this relationship is multifaceted, including a possible philosophical replacement of
                    a Western conception of God, Plessner argues. As Western populations have secularized, or at least
                    fled institutionalized ideas of church and God, over the last century (Chaves and Voas, 2016), and
                    because many technology companies operate within Western physical and philosophical spaces, this is
                    a plausible idea worth exploring. As someone raised in a culturally Western home with a belief in a
                    Judeo-Christian God, I was introduced taught about an entity with extraordinary properties. One of
                    these is limitless or near-limitless knowledge, which provides an ability to perfectly know the
                    future. This mirrors utopian ideas around big data, which describe a technology that, with enough
                    data input into the system, can perfectly or near-perfectly model the future. Another such
                    extraordinary property of the Judeo-Christian God is limitless or near-limitless power, through
                    which anything conceivable can be achieved. This again mirrors utopian beliefs about big data, which
                    state that through more information everything from ideal law enforcement to personalized medicine
                    can be achieved with large enough data sets. The third extraordinary characteristic of the
                    Judeo-Christian God is perfect goodness, which is expressed in light of His complete knowledge and
                    through His unlimited power. And again, these utopian beliefs, which are fundamentally optimistic
                    about the use of big data, mirror this idea of inherent goodness, focussing on the outcomes of
                    policy implementations and technology roll-outs which bring value to people’s lives instead of those
                    which might subtract value or concentrate it among a privileged few.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Though few scholars or professionals in big data would hold beliefs which mirror the claims about
                    the Judeo-Christian God’s omniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence in terms of their strength or
                    immutability, the fact that such simple comparisons can be drawn is cause for careful consideration
                    of the degree to which such concepts are valid within the space of big data, and in reference to
                    technology in general. With Chinese use of big data to commit genocide against the Uyghur people of
                    Xinjiang and to track even extremely minor infractions against the state for purposes of
                    totalitarianism, the knowledge and power provided by the technology is clearly significant. But
                    benevolence is missing from this example and many other implementations of policies using big data,
                    and as such it is important to consider the complexities of the real world and how the drive for a
                    simplified and certain reality can harm real people, who cannot be reduced to points of data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Keymolen ends her paper with two key ideas; that big data could be used for control and certainty at
                    the expense of freedom and opportunity, and that a world in which big data has stripped life of its
                    complexity would be boring and lack in the beauty of human lived complexity. The first idea is one
                    which has both clear relevance and importance in today’s increasingly technology-driven world,
                    because the threat of control over freedom, and even life, has materialized. As such, great care is
                    necessary to ethically implement big data technology. The second idea, however, seems to contradict
                    Keymolen’s earlier assertion that what it is to be human “does not allow itself to be pinned down
                    that easily”, and that there are fundamental philosophical barriers which big data cannot
                    circumvent. I also see a mistake I used to make with regards to the relationships between beauty,
                    complexity, and knowledge. To state that “complex things, such as art, music, love, and friendship”
                    could ever be stripped of the complexity which is the basis for so much of their beauty is to
                    misunderstand the nature of complexity within artefacts and within human life. The complexity of
                    paint on canvas cannot be diminished by the knowledge that its varying shades are the product of
                    photons reflecting at slightly different wavelengths, nor can a data-intensive study of colour
                    choice in art take away even one of the millions of shades used and experienced in paintings. And
                    the knowledge that love is regulated by the chemical oxytocin does nothing to reduce the complexity
                    or beauty of human relationships. Even if data of a billion brain scans could be used to identify
                    neural firing patterns that perfectly predict the experience of love, no part of that experience or
                    that phenomenon could be stripped of its immense beauty and complexity. </p>

                <h1>A Close Reading of <i>Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics</i></h1>
                <p>
                    As improvements in the graphical capabilities of computers and worldwide internet infrastructure
                    have allowed for visually rich representations of all kinds to be shared more and more widely, data
                    visualizations have emerged as a powerful form of analysis, persuasion, and artistic expression.
                    Fernanda B. Viégas and Martin Wattenberg’s paper, Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual
                    Analytics, asks important questions about the role that data visualization plays not only in its
                    native scientific context as a tool of analytic inquiry, but also as a tool of persuasion and
                    rhetoric, carrying stories from a perspective that is not and does not purport to be objective or
                    free from a forceful point of view. The examples cited throughout the paper also call into question
                    where a line can be drawn between that which is science and that which is artistic expression or
                    interpretation. While Viégas and Wattenberg explicitly sidestep this question as beyond the scope of
                    their exploration, they do provide resources valuable for taking the first steps towards
                    investigating the blurry middle-ground between science and art.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Important to an engagement with the subject matter of data visualization is a basic understanding of
                    its fundamental properties and current and historical use cases. Though the idea that the human
                    brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text is a myth, it is true that visual processing
                    can occur very rapidly and with high fidelity, with meaningful information in an image able to be
                    extracted within 13 milliseconds, or almost one one-hundredth of a second (Trafton, 2020). This
                    ability of human perception is quite extraordinary, and allows for much greater decipherable
                    information density within both physical and temporal space. With the ability to communicate
                    intricate or information-dense ideas, it is unsurprising that data visualization is used in the
                    scientific field, as concepts and patterns which are often complex or unintuitive can be made more
                    easily accessible through visual representation. This use case extends to the broader communication
                    of complex ideas and phenomenon, as the current reality of social media pervasion means that
                    people’s attention is a resource being competitively fought over by billion and trillion-dollar
                    corporations, and that effective communication must take into account the fact that attention is a
                    scarce resource.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Similarly, social media dominance has created a space in which persuasion is a key goal of many
                    megacorporations, as effective advertising is the financial backbone of some of the largest
                    companies in the world such as Google and Facebook. This has created a paradigm in which even
                    science and academia in general are forced to participate in the attention and persuasion games on
                    the web. For an author to forego tweeting about work they have published is to forego citations and
                    influence (Klar et. al, 2020). And to tweet without a visual, an image, is to tweet foregoing an
                    average five times engagement increase over tweeting without a visual (Geerlings, 2014). In an
                    academic environment where publishing is of extremely high importance, where the phrase ‘publish or
                    die’ is a mantra, and where social media is a key communications platform which favours images, data
                    visualizations take on a role that surpasses just that of an analytic tool.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This is where the distinctions between science, art, and persuasion become blurry. Viégas and
                    Wattenberg use the terms “sin” and “distortion” to describe what they see as deviations from
                    scientific and academic tradition in the creation of analytic tools. These include that which
                    “betrays” the creator’s “intent”, such as when Golan Levin’s use of internet search results as a
                    dataset shows his intention to “induce the viewer to ponder the roles of numbers in our culture”,
                    and the hand-alignment of images by Jason Salavon for “emphasis”. Yet, to deny that scientists and
                    academics make choices that emphasize certain interpretations of their work and the world, is to
                    deny an extraordinary amount of context which influences scientists and academics. Social media, as
                    discussed above, is one of these influences. Any hypothesis being tested is a significant influence
                    on how data will be interpreted and presented. The experiences and beliefs of any person will be
                    manifested in their work in some form, regardless of the rules, procedures, or behaviours in place
                    to minimise these influences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Similarly, the artistic intent which Viégas and Wattenberg use to differentiate art from analytic
                    tools, does not itself preclude any particular data visualization from accomplishing the goal of
                    scientific or academic work; to create knowledge. Any of the cases they cite could be used to
                    explore the implications inherent in each work or to draw conclusions about their individual subject
                    matter. For example, the skin tones in “Every Playboy Centerfold, The Decades (normalized), by Jason
                    Salavon”, clearly presented as they are with the intent to create awareness of artificial beauty
                    standards, could, regardless of their artistic intent, still be compared to survey results about
                    perceptions of beauty over time. This could perhaps provide insights into whether companies like
                    Playboy had an active role in leading public perception of beauty, or whether public perception,
                    influenced by other factors, led Playboy to change how it represented beauty on its centerfold.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Like the works used as examples by Viégas and Wattenberg, this hypothetical study has a fairly
                    transparent intent which could be gleaned simply by reading its description; to understand how
                    harmful and exclusive beauty standards come to be, and how that might inform efforts to limit their
                    development in future. And while any ethical and honest research must be done with a mind open to
                    questioning assumptions and interrogating intentions, this does not mean that it is a truly neutral
                    endeavour. Viégas and Wattenberg explore this idea at the end of their paper, asking whether it is
                    misguided to try to minimize points of view inherent in all visualizations, and whether persuasion
                    should be incorporated into the understanding of the purpose of visualizations. Yet they still end
                    with a dichotomy, a split between data visualization as a way “to support making a point”, and a
                    tool of “disinterested analysis”. Considering the complex ways in which both visualization as art
                    and visualization as analysis intersect each other, it is worth considering whether this distinction
                    is one worth keeping at all.

                <h1>A Reflection on <i>How Art Can Contribute To Ethical Reflection On Risky Technologies</i></h1>
                <p>We live in a world today with technologies which give us extraordinary power, such as the ability to
                    communicate at light-speed across the entire Earth, but these technologies also pose enormous risks
                    to individuals, groups, and to even the human species. As technologies continue to be created, it
                    would be unwise to move forward with the speed and carelessness of the scientists who developed the
                    atomic bomb, who were unsure whether an atomic blast could ignite the atmosphere and
                    near-instantaneously wipe out life on Earth when the first nuclear bomb was detonated. It would be
                    similarly unwise to “move fast and break things” even in areas of technology which seem far more
                    innocuous, such as social media, since the programmers who created social media platforms are
                    partially responsible for the elections of demagogues who were bolstered in support by conspiracy
                    theorists, hate groups, and foreign interference campaigns on these platforms. And it is important
                    to consider the energy usage of any new technology, as any rise in fossil fuel emissions as a result
                    of a new technology could easily outweigh its benefits. With these few examples showing the stakes
                    of living in a world with risky technologies, it is clear that every contribution to mitigation of
                    these risks, and every concerted effort towards safe and ethical technology development going
                    forward, is a valuable contribution to the grand effort of making the world a better place for all
                    who inhabit it.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>With this understanding, it is worth exploring Sabine Roeser’s How Art Can Contribute To Ethical
                    Reflection On Risky Technologies, and how it engages the role of the artist in the discussions and
                    development around risky technologies. One particular challenge to the democratic advancement of
                    technology is the fact that the complexity and opacity of it prevent many voices, whose bearers
                    would be themselves affected by the technology, from having a say due to a lack of expertise in the
                    research area in question. Roeser writes that techno-art has a role to play communicating across
                    this gap, and that it could “provide for concrete, vivid images and narratives that make
                    technological developments and their possible impact on society more tangible for a larger audience
                    than is possible via highly specialised scientific articles and abstract philosophical theorising”.
                    The idea that more lay-friendly communications of technological risk are important is one which has
                    significant support in the, admittedly academic, field of catastrophic risk research (Ord, 2020).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Inherent in any discussion about risk is the need for grounding in ethics and moral philosophy.
                    However, while most people hold strong moral values that they wish to be honoured, few have the
                    expertise needed to formulate what are often emotional feelings into the language of philosophy, and
                    as such may not have their real moral beliefs heard. Roeser presents the possibility that art could
                    be a way through which these intuitions, emotions, and feelings can find voice as moral values and
                    concerns, using the work of Stelarc as an example of a way the visual possibilities of the future
                    can inform the direction we collectively wish to take, one with further technological integration,
                    or one without. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Roeser also explores the idea that novel experiences can inform deliberation in ways which logical
                    thinking or academic study simply cannot. Though she does not choose to refer to evidence regarding
                    the impact of experience on moral and emotional deliberation, it is worth touching on this as there
                    is much to learn from other experiences which provide moral clarity and encourage reflection on
                    risk. Astronauts often describe what is called “the overview effect” after returning from space
                    having seen the earth as a whole from above. It is supposedly a humbling effect, one which creates a
                    longing for connection between all peoples, as there are no boundaries such as country borders
                    visible from space, only an earth which appears fragile and precious, on which we all live.
                    Testimonies after this experience often move from emotional sensations of awe and wonder to a kind
                    of moral mandate provided by the experience, one of protection of the planet and togetherness of
                    humanity and of nature. And the lasting effects of the change in perspective many astronauts undergo
                    are often enormous (Yaden et al, 2016). Though a tall order, it is possible that techno-art could
                    accomplish somewhat similar experiences that could serve as an “equal footing” for stakeholders to
                    deliberate. </p>
                <br>
                <p>With important ideas around technological risk in need of reflection from people of all walks of
                    life, techno-art may provide an avenue through which lay-people can engage in some of the most
                    important discussions and decision-making processes of our time.</p>

                <h1>A Reflection On <i>Which Fish Are OK To Eat?</i></h1>
                <p>Many data visualizations come loaded with an entire worldview which informs every aspect of the
                    information and the message they communicate. Often, this is hidden because the viewer and the
                    creator of the visualization hold the same core assumptions and beliefs about the world, but when
                    fundamental differences are present, it is possible for a visualization to communicate entirely
                    different information than was its creators intent. These cases provide not just insight into the
                    persuasive mechanisms used in data visualization, but also the way in which hegemony can assert
                    itself subversively.

                </p>
                <br>

                <p>The visualization Which Fish Are OK To Eat? on the website Information is Beautiful is one example of
                    this. Its intent is made clear by its title, it aims to inform viewers of which kinds of fish can be
                    eaten with moral justification, and which fish, because of a number of factors such as animal
                    welfare and environmental harm, cannot. These factors can be toggled on and off, so if someone does
                    not care about the toxins fish sometimes carry, they can see that reflected in the visualization.
                    After the viewer has toggled the factors they believe are relevant to whether or not they should eat
                    a particular animal, those that remain are “OK to eat”.


                </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, inherent in this visualization is the hegemonic carnist ideology that the consumption of
                    meat can be ethically justified. As I am a vegan, the idea that these fish are “OK to eat” in any
                    moral sense is extraordinarily problematic, and the inclusion of two particular toggles illustrates
                    the way in which a data visualization has been used to mislead the viewer into believing that what
                    they are doing by consuming a particular species of fish is ethical. The first of these toggles is
                    the “Vegetarian” toggle, which was clearly included to fend off the kind of criticism I am now
                    engaged in, as the author could simply state that as a vegan, I should use that toggle and the
                    visualization would produce the correct answer for my personal beliefs. However, this is not nearly
                    an adequate response, as is demonstrated by the second toggle, labelled “Animal Welfare”. When this
                    toggle is turned on, and all others toggled off, it shows that the only thing this toggle does is
                    remove farmed fish from the list. And while this is a step in the right direction, and some of the
                    fish that experience the greatest suffering are from the list removed with the toggle “Cruel
                    Fishing” turned on, there are a few notable exceptions. Among them is the octopus.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Octopuses are among the most intelligent creatures on earth, have been shown to display behaviours
                    such as play, and can develop emotional relationships in much the same way as dogs do when in
                    prolonged contact with humans. And while the visualization focusses only on the way in which “fish”
                    are caught, the ways they are slaughtered for food are important for the consideration of their
                    welfare and the cruelty inherent in consuming them. Octopuses are often cut up while alive and have
                    to watch as their tentacles are consumed in front of them, or are swallowed whole, a practice that
                    is both dangerous for the human consuming them and unmistakably cruel to the octopus. </p>
                <br>
                <p>These practices are worth exploring in detail because of the extraordinary way in which they
                    contradict the claim of the visualization that considering “Animal Welfare” and “Cruel Fishing”,
                    octopuses are “OK to eat”. With the personalization that the is offered by the visualization, the
                    moral language which is employed, and the referencing of purportedly trustworthy sources on the
                    topic such as “GreenPeace, Good Fish Guide, Monterey Bay Aquarium”, an air of objectivity is created
                    which is highly unrepresentative of both the current moral landscape of around fish suffering in
                    academia, and, in my view, the objective reality that consuming fish is practically always
                    extraordinarily cruel. </p>

                <h1>A Reflection On <i>Coronavirus Riskiest Activities</i></h1>
                <p>The coronavirus has overturned everyone’s lives this year, and it has been difficult for many people, including myself, to navigate the extra complexities added to every activity that involves possible exposure to the virus. Among the more helpful resources I have found on the internet are data visualizations which rank different activities according to their likely associated risk of coronavirus infection. These visualizations map a way for evaluating the kind of risk vs benefit decisions that need to be made on an almost daily basis now. 


                </p>
                <br>

                <p>The visualization Coronavirus Riskiest Activities on the website Information is Beautiful specifies three categories of low risk, medium risk, and high risk activities. While this alone could imply that the “low risk” activities could be done without much thought put towards personal safety, this implication is largely avoided by clever use of other signifiers in the visualization. Of these, the use of a yellow to red colour scheme provides a sense of danger across the board, rather than using a green colour which could have implied a sense of safety at the low end of risk. Additionally, small snippets of important information are dotted throughout the risks from low to high, which not only creates a feeling that thoughtfulness and close inspection is necessary across the board, but it also spreads out snippets of information across an interesting visual scene rather than creating an unengaging list of tips.


                </p>
                <br>
                <p>These factors make the data visualization quite effective, but there are areas of communication which could have been done in a way that would have better represented the realities of some of these risks. For example, the size of the risk circle for “outdoor exercise” is such that four or five of these circles could fit in the “indoor bar” risk circle. The implication here is that a four-to-one ratio of risk is being represented. However, this is at least an order of magnitude off, as four sessions of outside exercise is enormously safer than visiting an indoor bar even once.</p>

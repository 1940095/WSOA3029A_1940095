                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
              <p>My name is Connor, and I’m a high school librarian working in Johannesburg, South Africa. I’m
                also a newly minted blogger, planning to post to this website at least biweekly. </p>
                <br><p>You might be wondering, what is this blog all about? And how did I come to start writing it?</p>
            <br><p>Quite simply, this blog is about information and how we interact with it. Growing up in Johannesburg, I was
                interested in things that felt closeby, like novels set in South Africa and my high school chess team. The
                world of technology felt centred far outside of my reality, and often entirely out of reach. For those who
                experienced the progressive decline of Internet accessibility in South African over the last decade, you
                know that my feelings were not without justification. For younger readers or those outside of the country,
                let me give some background. Starting around 2020, changes to the climate created extreme and unpredictable
                currents, regularly damaging the undersea cables which connect South Africa to the rest of the Internet.
                Additionally, endemic load shedding has hurt the capabilities of server centres across the country,
                compounding the issue. As such, data costs have risen and accessibility has gradually diminished.
            </p>
            <br><p>But a few years ago, during my time at UCT, I became interested in the study of information. I took classes
                that expanded my access to the Internet and I was surprised to find how much South Africans were doing, even
                with limited resources. I was also amazed by how much things had changed, and the new ways people all over
                the world were making information accessible, digestible, and engaging to larger audiences. Those
                experiences inspired me to become a librarian, and now that I’ve settled in at my new job, I’d like to keep
                exploring with this blog.

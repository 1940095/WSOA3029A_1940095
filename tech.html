      <h1>A Reflection On My Own Stress in 2020</h1>
      <p>It is no secret to any of my friends, family, or university lecturers that 2020 has been a stressful year for
        me. Nor would it be a surprise to anyone that a year with a massive pandemic, a pivotal US election, and a
        worldwide reckoning with systemic racial injustice, would reasonably create a more stressful environment than
        usual. In this context I have struggled balancing my mental health, physical health, responsibilities at home,
        university assignments, and volunteer work all at once. And up until the last few weeks, I thought I would be
        able to largely manage things on my own, even if some sacrifices had to be made considering the circumstances.


      </p>
      <br>

      <p>However, I began to feel what I now know are the physical symptoms stress can create in the body. The first
        things I thought to do were exercise and diet related. I thought exercise could snap me out of drowsiness and
        fatigue, and that eating nutrient dense foods and drinking sugary drinks could alleviate symptoms of brain fog
        and anxiety, which might be related to diet or low blood sugar levels. However, I continued to experience
        worsening symptoms, including odd feelings like pins and needles and lightheadedness. So I booked a doctor's
        appointment. When he checked my heartrate and found a BPM of over 100, and when an ECG found a similar rate of
        over 90 BPM, I was sure my bloodwork would come back pointing to something physically wrong that would explain
        my symptoms. But my bloodwork came back without a single issue. My doctor asked if I had been experiencing any
        mental health issues such as stress, and I told him I had, and that I was in the middle of my end-of-year exams.


      </p>
      <br>
      <p>But being diagnosed with anxiety related to stress felt like a cheap, fake, or inadequate answer. A thyroid
        issue or a circulatory problem would have been so much more tangible, so much more of a 'real' problem. The
        words coming out of a doctor's mouth helped, and picking up medication made the problem more physical than it
        had been, but a feeling of invention lingered. Because the illness came from my head, it felt as I had just
        thought it up, rather than that I was suffering from something as real as any physically derived illness. But I
        knew I believed, even though it was difficult to believe in my own particular situation, that mental health
        issues are real and important in the same way physical health issues are. So I set about convincing myself that
        my stress is real and connected to the physical symptoms I had been experiencing recently.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>In my day-to-day life, I often go to data visualizations to ground myself in the best pictures of reality I can
        find. This year I have used them to track the impacts of coronavirus, the US election, and other important
        phenomenon affecting me and the world around me. So, to find some quantitative grounding on which my more
        rational brain could override the emotions I was feeling around my diagnosis, I decided to gather data. I
        searched for the frequency at which I wrote the word "stress" in relation to my own mental state at the time in
        direct messages with friends on the app Telegram over the course of 2020. Though the number of data points I
        have is not enough for a peer-reviewed scientific paper, and my methodology is not carefully vetted to an
        extraordinary academic standard, I was still able to find a clear pattern. There is a steady, sharp, and
        consistent rise in my mentions of the word "stress" over the course of the year, peaking this month in
        concurrance with the US election and the beginning of exam season.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>This use of data visualization has provided me with a tool I can use to validate my own experiences, even when
        my emotions pull me in another direction.
